## Smart Contract Details

The subscription smart contract is designed with the following key components:

- **Issuer and Brand**: For handling payments in fungible tokens.
- **Recurring Payments**: Ensures automatic debits for subscriptions.
- **Flexible Terms**: Allows dynamic adjustment of subscription plans.

The contract is implemented using Agoric's Zoe and ERTP (Electronic Rights Transfer Protocol) frameworks, ensuring secure and composable transactions.
